# Number Guesser Neural Network

This program is my version of solving the MNIST Digit data set. It allows the user to draw a number on the screen and have the program take a guess of which digit it is. This uses a basic neural network model.

You can watch this video on how the program works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNW97izstLg
